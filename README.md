# Quincy Notre Dame Computer Science

This repository contains presentations, lesson templates, and solutions for a 4 week C for a 4 week Computer Science program with 5 40 minute sessions per week.

This serves an audience of Freshmen at Quincy Notre Dame in Quincy Illinois, in classes of around 22 students. The main objectives are:

1. Teach computer science fundamentals through experiential learning in Python.
2. Educate students about opportunities in computer science.
3. Include all students, even those who may not have a pre-conceived interest in computer science.
4. Complete fun projects that students can be proud of.


Each session will have roughly 15 minutes of lecture/direct instruction, followed by 25 minutes of "lab time" to solve an open-ended problem.
