# Stocks

- Use `yfinance` python package to fetch stock data
- Just a few lines of code!
```python
import yfinance as yf

google = yf.Ticker("GOOG")  # Fetches data
info = google.info  # Dictionary with many options
price = info["currentPrice"]  # Get the current price
print(f"One share of Google is worth ${price}")
```
- Extra Credit:
    - Use Matplotlib to show a stock graph
