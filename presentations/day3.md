# Booleans

- George Boole
    - In 1854 wrote *The Laws of Thought*
    - New algebra
- Booleans can either be `True` or `False`

# Example

```python
is_old_enough_to_drive = True
my_team_won = False
fr_fr_on_god_no_cap = True
```

# Conditions

`>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`

```python
age = input("How old are you? ")
greater = age > 16

print("Age is greater than 16: " + str(greater))
```

- What is the output if I enter 25?
- 13?
- 16? 

---

# if else

What do you think this will print out?

```python
age = 14

if age >= 16:
    print("You are old enough to drive a car")
else:
    difference = 16 - age
    print(f"You'll be old enough in {difference} years")
```

<!-- This is where we introduce f-strings for concatenation-->
<!-- Explain that normal concatenation is fine, but this is preferred among most programmers-->
<!-- Handles the annoying str thing for you -->

---

# elif


```python
if age > 18:
    print("You are old enough to vote and drive")
elif age >= 16:
    print(f"You are old enough to drive and can vote in {18 - age} years")
else: 
    print(f"You can drive in {16 - age} years")
```
- What is the output if age is 25?
- 13?
- 16? 

<!-- -->
<!-- Multiple conditions! -->

# What do you think this does?

```python
if hometown == "Chicago" or favorite_team == "Blackhawks":
    print("Wow, you are a cool guy")
else:
    print("You have poor taste")
```
<!-- -->
<!-- You can use and in a similar way -->

# Project 

Extend our calculator from yesterday

Ask the user to choose an operation using `input`
Add, subtract, multiply, divide

Use `if, elif, else` to perform that operation

---

# Bonus
- What happens if you divide by 0?
- Add exponenentiation (**)
- Add remainder (%)
- Add integer division (//)
