# Nested Ifs

- You can put if statements inside of other if statements

```swift
...
if guess == "Hot To Go" {
    console.write("That's right! Chappel Roan's Hot To Go is the song of the summer.")
    console.write("What's the best movie of the year?")
    let movie = readLine()!
    if movie == "Dune: Part Two" {
        console.write("Giant Sand Worms >>>> Anything else")
    } else if movie == "Deadpool and Wolverine" {
        console.write("Cameo cringefest ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž")
    } else {
        console.write("Wrong answer, try again!")
    }
} else if guess == "Espresso" || guess == "Please Please Please" {
...
```

# Make Your Own

- Give the user some story and a simple choice
- Use nested `if` statements to console.write what happens next
- You can have more than 2 options at each choice!
- 3 choices total
- Be creative!
- *Keep it appropriate*
