# Functions!

- You've used functions already
- `print("something")`
- `input("prompt")`
- `open("file", "w")`
- `random.choice([1, 2, 3])`
- We can make our own!

# What does this output?

```python
def multiply_string(string):
    output = ""
    for i in range(3):
        output += string
    return output

print(multiply_string("ðŸš€"))
print(multiply_string("ðŸ”¥"))
```
