- Sometimes called maps or hashmaps
- Establish a relationship between *key* and *value*
    - Keys must be unique
    - Value can be anything

- Lookup with `[]` like a list

# Project

- Continue Wordle
- Let the user play repeatedly
- Use a dictionary to track how many guesses it took for each secret word
- Print out the dictionary at exit
- Bonus:
    - Multiple word banks for different letter counts
